Hello Secretariat of the Committe eagainst Torture,

i write to you to to provide reliable information that indicates that torture if systematically practised in the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (article 20.1)

i informed the king of the netherlands that the medicine used in his forced treatements are not medicine but poison (see 1).

i received information of the king that he is informed that these medicine are poison (see 2).

since poison is used instead of a cannot do harm medicine the king is not making laws that give care, he is systematically torturing with laws that use poison.

i've already tried to get the prosecutor arrest the king of the netherlands for genocide, but the prosecutor is unable to act (see 3).

i hope that you informedness of the king being informed that these are not medicine but poison will enable the committee to stop the king with his systematical torture on the territory of the Netherlands.

looking forward to your reaction,
