Hello Office of the Prosecutor,

i write you in the context of communications and claims under art.15 of the Rome Statute. I want to inform the prosecutor that the king of the netherlands and his government are commiting 3 of the 5 crimes defined in the Rome Statute.
I know the statute only provides juridistion over genocide claims concerning nationalities or crimes based on etnicity. The crimes i talk about are on generic parts of the population like all elderly of all psychiatric patients.
The kingdom of the netherlands uses law to provide "care" with entails adminstering poison instead of non harmfull substances (what medicine should be). 

There is proof the medication used in forced treatements in the netherlands are poison.

1) clozapine (leponex) - https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.024.831
2) olanzapine (zyprexa) - https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.125.320
3) aripriprazole (abilify) https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.112.532

4) haloperiodol (haldol) - https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.000.142

The dutch government has introduced three new forced care laws, the Wfz (wet forensische zorg) for criminals, the WvGGZ (Wet verplichte GGZ) for the disturbed and addicted and the Wzd (Wet zorg en dwang) for the handicapped.

Instead of groups with an nationaliteit or etnicity the laws targets the following victim groups in the netherlands:

1) verslaafden (addicts)
2) bejaarden (elderly)
3) ggz patienten (psychiatric patients)
4) criminelen (criminials)
5) gehandicapten (handicapped)
 
I informed the eerste kamer (who votes for the laws to be signed by the king) about the fact that these medicine as poison before the voted for these laws, i also informed the king about the fact that these medicine are poison before the law took effect.
Confirmation by the greffe and director of the kings cabinet are provided with this email (1).

With the laws that give instructions to "treat" certain groups in the population and the medicine used in that treatement turns out to be poison, the kingdom of the netherlands is, with the signature of the king, committing the following crimes mentioned in article 6:

a) Killing members of the group
b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group
c) .
d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
e) .


Since the members of the chamber and the king were aware that these medicine are poison at the time they voted for this law and the day the Wfz law took effect (1-1-2019) i ask the prosecutor to prosecute 
the king and members of the chamber for three genocide crimes mentioned in article 6 on the note that this does not entail etnicity or nationality but on general groups in the population.

I hope you can stop the above mentioned crimes the king of the netherlands and his government are doing.

state of affairs
================

"Under the Rome Statute, the Court may only exercise jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, as
defined in the Rome Statute (Articles 6 to 8), when committed on or after 1 July 2002 (Article 11). In addition,
the Court may only exercise jurisdiction over such crimes committed on the territory of a State that has accepted
the jurisdiction of the Court or by a national of such a State (Article 12), or where the Security Council refers the
situation to the Court (Article 13). In the light of these requirements, your communication still appears, after
careful re-examination, to relate to matters outside the jurisdiction of the
Court."

These requirements are:

1) exercise jurisdiction over genocide if it is after 2002

and

2) the netherlands accepts jurisdiction y the Court over genocide.

or

3) a genocide crime is committed by a national of the jurisdiction accepted state.

or

4) the security counsil refers the genocide to the prosecutor.

My interpretation:

"By adding Article 11 to the requirements, the prosecutor is actualy calling
it a genocide and is missing the cooperation of the netherlands to arrest
it's own king and thus stop the kings genocide."
